# Project Creation on the IBISBAKHub

## Purpose

To create a project on IBISBAKHub. This tutorial assumes you’ve already created your account on the IBISBAKHub. Instructions to create an account can be found [here](https://ibisba.github.io/handbook/hub_account_creation.html).

For the purpose of this workshop we'll be working on a sandbox environment, where you can freely playaround without the fear of breaking anything. If you're interested to play around create an account on the [https://sandbox10.fairdomhub.org/](https://sandbox10.fairdomhub.org/)


**Step1:**

Go to [https://sandbox10.fairdomhub.org/](https://sandbox10.fairdomhub.org/) and “Log in” to your account

**Step2:**

After logging in click on the “*Create”* tab and from the pull-down menu select “*Project”* and a New Project page will open. Fill in the sections using the following information

**Title:**

*Project: An inventory of the Aspergillus niger secretome*

**Description:**

*Protein secretion usually requires the presence of a N- terminal signal peptide (SP) and by scanning for this feature using available highly accurate SP-prediction tools, the fraction of potentially secreted proteins can be directly predicted. We were able to improve the in silico inventory of Aspergillus niger secretory proteins by combining different gene-model predictions from neighbouring Aspergilli and thereby avoiding prediction conflicts associated with inaccurate gene-models. An experimental validation of the predicted proteome confirmed in silico predictions.*

**Institution:**

Type the name of the Institution: Start typing and if your institute is registered it will appear in the list. If it doesnt type the full name and then select the item. After this you can provide additional details about your institution such as:

**Website:**

For example: *https://www.manchester.ac.uk*

**City:**

For example: *Manchester*  

**Country:**

For example: *United Kingdom*

**Step3:** 

> Click the “*Submit*” button and you will be shown a page to review the details and then

> Click the “*Create*" button. Voila your Project has been created 😇!

### Approval step

*If you are creating a Project within a Programme you administer, then there is no approval step. You will be shown a page to review the details and be able to create straight away.*

*Otherwise, an appropriate administrator will be notified by email about your request.  The administrator will be shown a page that allows them to quickly review the details and either accept or reject the request, and in either case you will be notified by email.*

### Optional Steps


**Step4:** Click on the Actions tab and select: “*Manage Project*” to edit any details about the project if you wish and add more information  for e.g.

**Topic annotations:**
For e.g. Biotechnology  

**Funding codes:**
Fill if applicable, for example "*EU Horizon 2020 730976*"  

**Public web page:**
Fill if applicable, for example: “[*https://www.ibisba.eu*](https://www.ibisba.eu)”

**Internal web page:**
Fill if applicable, for example: “[*https://www.example.com*](https://www.example.com)”  

**Start date:** *2025/03/01*         **End date:**  *2028/12/31*  
**Associated programme:**
Click and choose *“IBISBA Workshop”* from the list of options 

**Your Institution:**
Click and choose your respective institution from the list  

**Organisms:**
Choose “*Aspergillus niger*” from the list available  

**Default License:**
From the list choose “*Creative Common License*”

**Default Sharing Policy:**
This will be done after the project is created.  

**Discussion Channels:**
Add one or more URLs to point to discussion channels related to this Project.  
Otherwise, leave empty.

**Step5:** Again, from the *Actions tab* select “*Administer Project members*”:

1. Write the name of person you wish to add under the Add Members tab
2. Select the associated Institute name  
3. > Click the “*Confirm changes*" button

**Step6:** Again, from the *Actions tab* select “*Administer Project members roles*”:

1. Add the name of the person you wish to assign administrative roles under Project Administrator  
2. > Click the “*Confirm changes*" button
