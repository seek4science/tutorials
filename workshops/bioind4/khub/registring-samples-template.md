# Creating Samples from a template

You can bulk-create samples by populating a template and uploading as a Datafile. Once uploaded it should be recognised as having originated from a sample type template, and an option to extract samples will be displayed as a button.

## Step 1

Download the file [Samples_A.Niger.xlsx](data/Samples_A.Niger.xlsx)

## Step 2

Assuming you are already logged in click the Create button from the top-navigation bar and from the drop-down menu select “datafile” and a new page will open up: Upload datafile(3.Samples_A.Niger.xlsx)

## Step 3

Fill in the sections using the following information:

***Title:*** Samples used for the Aspergillus Niger experiments

***Description:*** Secretome enriched fractions of A. niger cultured under controlled conditions in defined synthetic media and analysed by high-throughput mass spectrometry

***Projects:*** Assign this datafile to the project to which it belongs:

- \<Your Name> Project: An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome

--***Click “NEXT”***--

***Step 4:*** License and Permissions

On this page you add additional properties to the datafile such as

- Associate it with Discussion Channels
- Add associated publications
- Events related to this datafile
- Associated Observations Units

Hit the “Create” button.

## Step 5

From the top panel of options click “Extract Samples” and you will be directed to a new page

## Step 6

Select “Sample Type” from the list and click “Continue”. It will take a few moments to extract the Samples

## Step 7

Click on the “Review Extracted Samples” and check whether the data looks right to you

## Step 8

Click “Confirm” and the samples will be assigned to your Project.

Using the “Explore” button you can:

- view the contents of the file
- plot the data
- add annotation

<!-- Commented [2]: is this still valid? -->

- manage the file,
- delete the file or
