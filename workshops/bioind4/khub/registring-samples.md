# Sample Registration

To register Samples we have to create Sample Types. Sample Types are templates that detail the key information that needs to be included to describe a given sample correctly.

***A Sample Type can be made in two ways:***

- By manually defining the attributes using a form
- Uploading a spreadsheet that contains a Sample Template
- Using the FAIR Data Station

In this section we will be creating Samples using a spreadsheet containing the ***Sample Type Template***

## Step 1

Download the file [Samples_A.Niger.xlsx](data/Samples_A.Niger.xlsx)

## Step 2

Assuming you are already logged in click the Create button from the top-navigation bar and from the drop-down menu select “Sample Types” and a new page New Sample Type will open up:

### Choose the tab Use spreadsheet template

## Step 3

Fill in the sections using the following information:

**Title:** Samples used for the Aspergillus Niger experiments

**Description:** Secretome enriched fractions of A. niger cultured under controlled conditions in defined synthetic media and analysed by high-throughput mass spectrometry

**Projects:** Assign to the project to which it belongs:

- \<Your Name> Project: An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome

## Step 4

Permissions and template Upload

**Sharing Policy:**  Choose “No access” if you wish to keep the datafile private

***Click “File to Upload”:*** Samples_A.Niger.xlsx and then `Hit the “Create” button.

From here you will be taken to a page containing the metadata, and a list of the attribute names from the template file.

Here you can select specific attribute types. You are also free to delete, rename or reorder the attributes.

## Step 5

Once Step 4 is completed click update. Your Sample Type can now be used to generate Samples.

### Optional Steps

Once the datafile is created, using the “Actions” drop down menu you can

- Edit Sample Type
- Manage Sample Type
- Delete Sample Type

## Step 6

From here you can now create your samples using the Create sample button

You’ll be directed to a New Sample page. Where you can add the following information:

- Sample Name
- Strain:
- Type:

### Projects

Assign the Sample to the project to which it belongs:

***Project:*** An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome

Permissions and template Upload

***Sharing Policy:*** Choose “No access” if you wish to keep the datafile private
