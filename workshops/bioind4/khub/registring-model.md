# Registering Models

**Purpose:** To register a model in SEEK

Download the model file provided in the workshop material:

- [penicillin_SVM_features_scaler.pkl](data/0007_[Python]_penicillin_SVM_features_scaler.pkl)

## Step 1

Assuming you are already logged in click the "Create" button from the top navigation bar and from the drop-down menu select "Model" and a new page will open up.

## Section 1

You can register your Model by either registering a URL or by uploading a file.

## Section 2

Fill in the sections using the following information:

***Title:*** Penicillin SVM features scaler model

***Description:*** Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a machine learning algorithm that applies the principles of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to regression tasks. It supports various kernels for complex patterns.

## Section 3

***Projects:*** Assign this model to a project you are part of

<!-- **Project:** An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome -->

***Note:*** You might get a pop-up message stating: "\<Project name> has a default sharing policy specified, do you want to apply it? NOTE that this will overwrite any previously defined permissions. Click "OK" to apply the default sharing policy or "Cancel" to keep the current permissions and not apply the default sharing policy."

## Section 4

License

***License:*** From the list choose "Creative Common License"

## Section 5 (optional)

Discussion Channels

You can associate this model with an existing discussion channel or create a new one. This will allow you to have discussions related to this model in the associated discussion channel.

## Section 6 - Model type details

- Model type: Choose the model type from the list. For e.g. "Agent Based Modelling"
- Model format: Choose the model format from the list. For e.g. "SBML"
- Preferred execution or visualisation environment: Choose the environment from the list. For e.g. "COPASI"

## Section 7 - Organism details

If the model is related to a specific organism, you can add the details of the organism here. For e.g. Aspergillus niger

## Section 8 - Sharing Policy

You can choose to keep the model private or share it with other users or make it public. If you choose to share it, you can specify the level of access other users will have to this model. For e.g. "Read only" or "Read and Write".

***Sharing Policy:*** Choose "No access" for the Public if you wish to keep the model private.

## Optional Steps

You can add additional properties to the model such as

- Creators: You can add the details of the creators of this model to give credit to the people who created this model.
- Tags: You can add some tags to the model which will help to describe it. For e.g. "Reannotation", "Protein Model", "Aspergillus niger"
- Attributions: If this Model is based on any existing Models
- Publications: You can add the details of the publications related to this model
- Modelling analyses: You can associate this model with an existing modelling analysis or create a new one. This will allow you to have all the details of the modelling analysis related to this model in one place.

Once you have filled in all the details, click the "Register" button to register this model in SEEK.
