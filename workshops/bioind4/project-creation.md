# Project Creation on the IBISBAKHub

## Purpose

To create a project on IBISBAKHub. This tutorial assumes you’ve already created your account on the IBISBAKHub. Instructions to create an account can be found here.

For the purpose of this workshop we'll be working on a sandbox environment, where you can freely playaround without the fear of breaking anything. If you're interested to play around create an account on the https://sandbox10.fairdomhub.org/

Step1: Go to https://sandbox10.fairdomhub.org/ and “Log in” to your account

Step2: After logging in click on the “Create” tab and from the pull-down menu select “Project” and a New Project page will open. Fill in the sections using the following information:

### Title

Project: An inventory of the Aspergillus niger secretome

### Description

Protein secretion usually requires the presence of a N- terminal signal peptide (SP) and by scanning for this feature using available highly accurate $S P$ -prediction tools, the fraction of potentially secreted proteins can be directly predicted. We were able to improve the in silico inventory of Aspergillus niger secretory proteins by combining different gene-model predictions from neighbouring Aspergilli and thereby avoiding prediction conflicts associated with inaccurate genemodels. An experimental validation of the predicted proteome confirmed in silico predictions.

### Institution

Type the name of the Institution: Start typing and if your institute is registered it will appear in the list. If it doesnt type the full name and then select the item. After this you can provide additional details about your institution such as:

### Website

For example: “https://www.manchester.ac.uk”

### City

For example: Manchester

### Country

For example: United Kingdom

## Step3

Click the “Submit” button and you will be shown a page to review the details and then the “Create” button. Voila your Project has been created ?.

### Approval step

If you are creating a Project within a Programme you administer, then there is no approval step. You will be shown a page to review the details and then create straight away.

Otherwise, an appropriate administrator will be notified by email about your request. They will also be notified directly when using FAIRDOM-SEEK. The administrator will be shown a page that allows them to quickly review the details and either accept or reject the request, and in either case you will be notified by email.
