# FAIR Data Station & FAIRDOM-SEEK

## Introduction

This document provides guidance on how to populate the IBISBA Knowledge Hub with your validated metadata file.

First you need to have access to a project within the IBISBA Knowledge Hub. If you do not have access to a project, please request one.

After you have access to a project, you can start populating it with your metadata file.

Make sure you have the following file ready:

- A validated RDF file from your metadata excel file.

## Uploading the RDF file

To upload the RDF file, follow these steps:

- Log in to the IBISBA Knowledge Hub environment.
- Go to the project where you want to upload the RDF file.
- Click on Actions
- Click on Import from FAIR Data Station

You can set the default permissions for all the entries that will be created by the content of the RDF file. By default no one will have access to the entries except you.

Feel free to change the permissions to your liking.

- Upload the RDF file by clicking on the "Choose File" button.
- Click on the "Submit" button.

***This might take a while depending on the size of the RDF file.***

## Checking the created entries

After the upload is complete, you can check the created entries in the project.
