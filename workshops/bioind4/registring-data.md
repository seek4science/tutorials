# Registering Datafiles and Samples

Purpose:

To register datafiles and create Sample Types for registering Samples

## Part 1: Registering Datafiles

Step1: Download the datafiles provided in the IBISBA_WorkShop_Material :

1. MassSpec_Results.xls
2. ProteinModelReannotation.doc

**Step2:** Assuming you are already logged in click the “Create” button from the topnavigation bar and from the drop-down menu select “datafile” and a new page will open up: Upload datafile(1.MassSpec_Results.xls)

You can also register a Data file by registering a URL to either another page or remote file

**Step 3:** Fill in the sections using the following information:

***Title:***

Proteins detected by high-throughput mass spectrometry of secretome Aspergillus Niger

***Description:***

Secretome enriched fractions of A. niger N402 cultured under controlled conditions in defined synthetic media were analysed by high-throughput mass spectrometry

***Projects:***

Assign this datafile to the project to which it belongs:

**Project:** An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome

**Tags:**

Add some tag to the datafile which will help to describe it, For e.g. Mass Spec Data

Click “NEXT”.

**Step 4:** License and Permissions

***License:***

From the list choose “Creative Common License”

Commented [1]: Add Link (Jupyter notebook or Google drive)?

***Sharing Policy:***

Choose “No access” if you wish to keep the datafile private

Click “NEXT”.

***Associated Assays:***

Associated this datafile to the ASSAY :“Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry”

from the list

You can also select an existing Experimental assay or Modelling analysis to associate with this Data file.

Click “NEXT”

On this page you add additional properties to the datafile such as

● Associate it with other datafiles
● Add associated publications
● Events related to this datafile

Hit the “Create” button.

***Optional Steps:***

Once the datafile is created, using the “Actions” drop down menu you can

● edit this file,
● manage the file,
● delete the file or
● upload a new version.

Using the “Explore” button you can:

● view the contents of the file
● plot the data
● add annotation

## Part 2: Sample Registration

To register Samples we have to create Sample Types. Sample Types are templates that detail the key information that needs to be included to describe a given sample correctly.

*A Sample Type can be made in two ways:*

● By manually defining the attributes using a form
● Uploading a spreadsheet that contains a Sample Template
● Using the FAIR Data Station

In this section we will be creating Samples using a spreadsheet containing the Sample

Type Template

***Step 1:*** Download the file “3.Samples_A.Niger.xlsx” from the IBISBA_WorkShop_Material

***Step 2:*** Assuming you are already logged in click the Create button from the top-navigation bar and from the drop-down menu select “Sample Types” and a new page New Sample Type will open up:

### Choose the tab Use spreadsheet template

***Step 3:*** Fill in the sections using the following information:

**Title:**

Samples used for the Aspergillus Niger experiments

**Description:**

Secretome enriched fractions of A. niger cultured under controlled conditions in defined synthetic media and analysed by high-throughput mass spectrometry

**Projects:**

Assign to the project to which it belongs:

- \<Your Name> Project: An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome

***Step 4:*** Permissions and template Upload

**Sharing Policy:**

Choose “No access” if you wish to keep the datafile private

Click “File to Upload” : 3.Samples_A.Niger.xlsx and then

Hit the “Create” button.

From here you will be taken to a page containing the metadata, and a list of the attribute names from the template file.

Here you can select specific attribute types. You are also free to delete, rename or reorder the attributes.

***Step 5:*** Once Step 4 is completed click update. Your Sample Type can now be used to generate Samples.

#### Optional Steps

Once the datafile is created, using the “Actions” drop down menu you can

● Edit Sample Type,
● Manage Sample Type
● Delete Sample Type

***Step 6:*** From here you can now create your samples using the Create sample button.

You’ll be directed to a New Sample page. Where you can add the following information:

- Sample Name
- Strain:
- Type:

#### Projects

Assign the Sample to the project to which it belongs:

Project: An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome

Permissions and template Upload

#### Sharing Policy

Choose “No access” if you wish to keep the datafile private

#### Creators

Observation Unit:

Hit the “Create” button.

#### Creating Samples from a template

You can bulk-create samples by populating a template and uploading as a Datafile. Once uploaded it should be recognised as having originated from a sample type template, and an option to extract samples will be displayed as a button.

***Step 1:*** Download the file “3.Samples_A.Niger.xlsx” from the IBISBA_WorkShop_Material

***Step 2:*** Assuming you are already logged in click the Create button from the top-

navigation bar and from the drop-down menu select “datafile” and a new page will open up: Upload datafile(3.Samples_A.Niger.xlsx)

***Step 3:*** Fill in the sections using the following information:

***Title:*** Samples used for the Aspergillus Niger experiments

***Description:*** Secretome enriched fractions of A. niger cultured under controlled conditions in defined synthetic media and analysed by high-throughput mass spectrometry

***Projects:*** Assign this datafile to the project to which it belongs:

- \<Your Name> Project: An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome

Press “NEXT”.

***Step 4:*** License and Permissions

***License:***

From the list choose “Creative Common License”

***Sharing Policy:***

Choose “No access” if you wish to keep the datafile private

Click “NEXT”

Associated Assays

Choose the existing assay to which the Sample belongs

Click “NEXT”

On this page you add additional properties to the datafile such as

- Associate it with Discussion Channels
- Add associated publications
- Events related to this datafile
- Associated Observations Units

Hit the “Create” button.

***Step 5:*** From the top panel of options click “Extract Samples” and you will be directed to a new page

***Step 6:*** Select “Sample Type” from the list and click “Continue”. It will take a few moments to extract the Samples

***Step 7:*** Click on the “Review Extracted Samples” and check whether the data looks right to you

***Step 8:*** Press “Confirm” and the samples will be assigned to your Project.

Using the “Explore” button you can:

- view the contents of the file
- plot the data
- add annotation

<!-- Commented [2]: is this still valid? -->

#### Optional Steps

Once the datafile is created, using the “Actions” drop down menu you can

- edit this file,
- manage the file,
- delete the file or
- Register new version.
