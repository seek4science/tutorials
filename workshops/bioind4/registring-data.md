# Registering Datafiles

**Purpose:** To register datafiles and create Sample Types for registering Samples

## Step 1

Download the datafiles provided in the workshop material:

1. [MassSpec_Results.xls](data/MassSpec_Results.xls)
2. [ProteinModelReannotation.doc](data/ProteinModelReannotation.doc)

## Step2

Assuming you are already logged in click the “Create” button from the topnavigation bar and from the drop-down menu select “datafile” and a new page will open up: Upload datafile(1.MassSpec_Results.xls)

You can also register a Data file by registering a URL to either another page or remote file

## Step 3

Fill in the sections using the following information:

***Title:*** Proteins detected by high-throughput mass spectrometry of secretome Aspergillus Niger

***Description:*** Secretome enriched fractions of A. niger N402 cultured under controlled conditions in defined synthetic media were analysed by high-throughput mass spectrometry

***Projects:*** Assign this datafile to the project to which it belongs:

**Project:** An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome

**Tags:** Add some tag to the datafile which will help to describe it, For e.g. Mass Spec Data

## Step 4

License and Permissions

***License:*** From the list choose “Creative Common License”

***Sharing Policy:*** Choose “No access” if you wish to keep the datafile private

--***Click “NEXT”***--

***Associated Assays:*** Associate this datafile to the ASSAY: `Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry` from the list. You can also select an existing Experimental assay or Modelling analysis to associate with this Data file.

--***Click “NEXT”***--

On this page you add additional properties to the datafile such as

- Associate it with other datafiles
- Add associated publications
- Events related to this datafile

Hit the “Create” button.

## Optional Steps

Once the datafile is created, using the “Actions” drop down menu you can

- edit this file,
- manage the file,
- delete the file or
- upload a new version.

Using the “Explore” button you can:

- view the contents of the file
- plot the data
- add annotation
