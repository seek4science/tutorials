## Sharing Scope

Share with different audiences:

### Private

- Only you can see the asset
- Use while preparing data
- Default for new uploads

### Project Members

- All members of linked projects
- Great for collaboration
- Respects project roles

### Programme Members

- Share across related projects
- Useful for consortia

### Public

- Visible to everyone
- Indexed by search engines
- Use for published data

## Setting Permissions

### During Creation

1. In the create form, find **Sharing**
2. Set default access level
3. Add specific people or groups
4. Click **Create**

### After Creation

## Project Roles

Project membership affects permissions:

| Role                | Default Permissions                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Administrator**   | Manage all project assets              |
| **Project Manager** | Edit project assets                    |
| **Member**          | View/Download project assets           |
| **Guest**           | View only project assets               |

## Sharing Policies

Create reusable policies for consistency:

1. Go to **My Profile** → **Policies**
2. Create a new policy
3. Define access levels
4. Apply to assets

## Best Practices

### During Active Research

- Keep data **Private** or **Project only**
- Share with collaborators as needed
- Use Edit access sparingly

### Before Publication

- Review all permissions
- Ensure proper attribution
- Check license compatibility

### After Publication

- Make data **Public**
- Create a **Snapshot** (immutable version)
- Register a **DOI** for citation

## Embargo and Delayed Sharing

Some installations support:

- Time-based access restrictions
- Automatic public release dates
- Contact your admin for availability

## Summary

| Stage            | Recommended Sharing |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Data collection  | Private             |
| Analysis         | Project members     |
